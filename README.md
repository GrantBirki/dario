# dario 🖊️

A minimal hugo theme inspired by Dario Amodei's personal [website](https://darioamodei.com/). It is designed to be as minimal, performant, and as elegant as possible for reading.

View the [live demo](https://log.birki.io) to see what it looks like.

## Installation

> To view a real example of a project using this theme, check out [grantbirki/log](https://github.com/GrantBirki/log) which is where I have the demo deployed.

Download the source of this repo (dario) as a zip from GitHub and extract in your themes directory at `<my_site>/themes/dario`.

Then, once you have the theme extracted, you can add it to your site's `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "dario"
```
